			<h2>Pancakes</h2>
			by Reginald F
			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
				<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
				<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
				<li>1 large egg</li>
				<li>1 cup milk</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Directions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
				<li>In another bowl, whisk the egg, and then add the milk, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla extract (if using). Mix well.</li>
				<li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps in the batter are okay.</li>
				<li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat and lightly grease it with oil or butter.</li>
				<li>Pour 1/4 cup portions of the pancake batter onto the hot skillet for each pancake. You can make them larger or smaller depending on your preference.</li>
				<li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake, then flip it with a spatula and cook the other side until it's golden brown.</li>
				<li>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and keep them warm.</li>
				<li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter.</li>
			</ul>
